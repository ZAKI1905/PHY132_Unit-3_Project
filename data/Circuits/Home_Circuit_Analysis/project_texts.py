**Project Objectives:**
- Apply Ohm’s Law and power calculations to estimate home appliance energy usage.
- Analyze current flow and voltage drops in simple household circuits.
- Evaluate power distribution and safety factors in a multi-branch circuit.
- Practice unit conversions and real-world reasoning with physics quantities.

- Choose at least **five common household appliances** (e.g., microwave, fridge, light bulb, space heater, fan).
- Find their power ratings from labels (in watts) or estimate based on typical values.

**Calculation Tasks:**
- For each appliance:
  - Estimate operating voltage \( V \) (typically 120 V in the U.S.)
  - Use \( P = IV \) to estimate current draw \( I \)
  - Use \( E = Pt \) to estimate daily energy use in kilowatt-hours (assume usage time \( t \))

**Guiding Questions:**
- Which appliances use the most power? Why?
- How would extended use affect your electricity bill?

- Draw a simplified **circuit diagram** representing a single room with at least three branches.
  - Include resistors (representing appliances), a power source (120 V), and wires.

**Circuit Considerations:**
- Use series and parallel combinations.
- Label current directions and voltage drops across each branch.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Which devices should be modeled in parallel versus in series?
- What are the consequences of adding too many devices to the same branch?

- Check if this exceeds a standard circuit breaker limit (e.g., 15 A or 20 A).
- Suggest how to re-balance or modify the circuit if the current is too high.

**Additional Task (Optional):**
- Add fuse or breaker symbols to your diagram and explain their function.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why are circuit breakers essential in real homes?
- How does your physics model help anticipate overloads?

- How can circuit design improve energy efficiency?
- What trade-offs exist between convenience, power, and cost?
