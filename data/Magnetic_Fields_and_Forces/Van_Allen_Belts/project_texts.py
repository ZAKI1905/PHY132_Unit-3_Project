**Project Objectives:**
- Understand the formation and structure of Earth’s radiation belts.
- Analyze how charged particles become trapped in Earth’s magnetic field.
- Apply magnetic force and circular motion concepts to real particle behavior in space.
- Evaluate how the belts impact satellites, astronauts, and space exploration.

- Define the Van Allen radiation belts.
- Describe their structure (inner and outer belts), location, and typical particle types.

**Diagram Task:**
- Draw a labeled cross-section of Earth’s magnetic field showing:
  - Inner and outer radiation belts
  - Earth's magnetic field lines
  - Particle motion paths

**Guiding Questions:**
- What types of particles are trapped in each belt?
- How are the belts formed from solar wind interactions?

- Describe the general motion of a charged particle in Earth’s magnetic field.
  - Gyration (circular motion around a field line)
  - Bounce motion (back and forth along the field line)
  - Drift motion (slow movement around Earth)

- For a proton with:
  - \( v = 4 \\times 10^6~\\text{m/s} \)
  - \( B = 4 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{T} \)
  - \( q = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C} \)
  - \( m = 1.67 \\times 10^{-27}~\\text{kg} \)

  calculate the radius of its gyration:
  \[
  r = \\frac{mv}{qB}
  \]

**Guiding Questions:**
- What does the small radius of motion suggest about confinement?
- Why do particles bounce between the poles instead of escaping?

- Explain the *magnetic mirror effect*: how increasing magnetic field strength near Earth’s poles reflects particles.
- Use the idea that the component of velocity parallel to the field decreases as magnetic field increases, conserving magnetic moment.

**Conceptual Calculation (no numbers):**
- Sketch or describe how a particle slows down and reverses direction near the poles.
- Indicate how energy is conserved even as velocity direction changes.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why do particles remain trapped instead of spiraling into Earth?
- What determines how far a particle can travel along the field line before it reflects?

- Describe how the radiation belts pose risks to spacecraft systems and human missions.
- Research or estimate the particle energies and exposure levels typical in low Earth orbit (LEO) versus within the belts.

**Application Task:**
- Suggest strategies that spacecraft use to avoid or shield against radiation belts (e.g., specific orbits, timing of launches, shielding).

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why are manned missions planned to avoid long exposure to these belts?
- Why are GPS satellites placed outside or between the belts?
