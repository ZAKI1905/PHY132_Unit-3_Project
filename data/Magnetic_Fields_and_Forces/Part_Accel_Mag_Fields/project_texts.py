**Project Objectives:**
- Understand how magnetic fields control the motion of charged particles in circular accelerators (e.g., cyclotrons, synchrotrons).
- Calculate particle trajectories, radii, and accelerations in uniform magnetic fields.
- Distinguish between how electric and magnetic fields influence speed and direction.
- Interpret real-world applications in medical, research, and industrial technologies.

- Define what a particle accelerator is and list common uses (e.g., medical imaging, cancer therapy, fundamental physics).
- Distinguish between *linear* and *circular* accelerators, with a focus on circular designs.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why do circular accelerators use magnetic fields instead of electric fields to steer particles?
- What role does a uniform magnetic field play in maintaining a circular path?

- Consider a proton of mass \( m = 1.67 \\times 10^{-27}~\\text{kg} \), charge \( q = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C} \), and speed \( v = 3 \\times 10^7~\\text{m/s} \).
- Let it enter a perpendicular magnetic field \( B = 0.2~\\text{T} \).
- Use the following to calculate its radius of motion:
  \[
  r = \\frac{mv}{qB}
  \]

**Guiding Questions:**
- How does increasing the speed or mass of the particle affect the radius?
- Why can this equation be thought of as a balance between magnetic and centripetal force?

- Use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of particle motion.
- Draw a diagram showing:
  - Velocity vector \( \\vec{v} \)
  - Magnetic field \( \\vec{B} \)
  - Magnetic force \( \\vec{F} \)

- Assume \( \\vec{B} \) points into the page and the particle enters from the left. Indicate whether the trajectory is clockwise or counterclockwise for:
  - A proton
  - An electron

- Why does the direction of curvature depend on the sign of the charge?
- How does the direction of magnetic force always remain perpendicular to the velocity?

- What is the maximum speed achievable before the particle escapes the circular path?
- Rearrange \( r = \\frac{mv}{qB} \) to solve for \( v \).

**Extension (Optional):**
- Research how real accelerators like CERN’s LHC or a synchrotron use magnetic fields to bend and electric fields to accelerate particles.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why are higher magnetic fields preferred for compact accelerator designs?
- How is circular motion maintained despite increasing particle energy?
