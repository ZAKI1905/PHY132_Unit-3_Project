- Consider a proton with:

  - \( m = 1.67 \\times 10^{-27}~\\text{kg} \)
  - \( q = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}~\\text{C} \)

- Calculate the radius of curvature of the proton’s path using:
  \[
  r = \\frac{mv}{qB}
  \]

**Diagram Task:**
- Draw the path of a proton being deflected into a patient’s body by a magnet.
- Show the role of magnetic field direction and proton charge in determining curvature.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why is the radius of curvature important in targeting specific tissue?
- How do doctors change the beam’s position in 3D?

- Explain how a series of magnets (e.g., dipole and quadrupole magnets) is used to focus and steer proton beams.
- Describe how the strength of the magnetic field and beam energy are adjusted during treatment.

**Calculation Task:**
- If the goal is to curve a proton beam to reach a tumor 10 cm off-center, estimate the required field strength \( B \), assuming a circular arc of radius \( r \) passes through that point.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What happens if the magnetic field is too strong or too weak?
- Why must the beam be both curved and focused?
