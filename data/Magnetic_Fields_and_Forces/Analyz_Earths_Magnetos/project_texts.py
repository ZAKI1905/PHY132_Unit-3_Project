**Project Objectives:**
- Clearly understand Earth’s magnetic field structure and its interaction with the solar wind.
- Conduct quantitative analysis of charged particle motion within the magnetosphere using algebra-based physics.
- Develop critical thinking and physics reasoning skills by analyzing NASA satellite data or simulated scenarios.
- Produce original diagrams, explanations, and numerical analysis that demonstrate clear physics understanding.

- Define the magnetosphere and describe the primary sources of Earth’s magnetic field.
- Draw a labeled diagram of Earth’s magnetic field lines showing:

  - Van Allen radiation belts

**Guiding Questions:**
- What generates Earth’s magnetic field?
- Why does it form a tear-drop shape rather than a sphere?

- Define “solar wind” and discuss its composition and speeds (~400–600 km/s).
- Explain (with diagrams) how the solar wind compresses Earth’s magnetic field to form the magnetopause.

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Use: Pₘₐgₙₑₜᵢc = B²/(2μ₀) (Assume B ≈ 25 nT, μ₀ = 4π×10⁻⁷ T·m/A)
- Use: P_dᵧₙₐₘᵢc = ρv² (with ρ ≈ 5×10⁻²¹ kg/m³, v ≈ 500 km/s)

**Guiding Questions:**
- How do these pressures determine the magnetopause position?
